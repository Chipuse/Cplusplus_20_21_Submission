Solution is not included, but can build with cmake with the included cmakelist


Controls:
  Player 1:
    wasd -> directions
    space -> action A
    altL -> action B
  Player 1:
    arrowkeys -> directions
    strgR -> action A
    shiftR -> action B
  Other:
    num1 -> load new character for player 1 (enter filename via console eg. "Lyn")
    num2 -> load new character for player 2 (enter filename via console eg. "Moon")

Character files in json format are located in the asset folder


Originally my intention was to make a runtime character editor to create new fighter from scratch or adjust existing ones, but I had no time.
In the end I just implemented serialization for the character Data and a way to serialize them either from instanced Fighter object or by EntityId and the actual data in the different properties. Later would be very useful/crucial for the character editor and maybe I will workon that in the future.
